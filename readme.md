<h1>CH2014 Impacts of Climate Change</h1>

<p>This repository includes R code that was used to analyze the potential response of the diversity of birds and vascular plants to ongoing climate change.  The code is structured to run on a SUN Grid Engine installation that was available at the Federal Research Institute WSL, in Birmensdorf, Switzerland.  A copy of the report chapter is available in this repository.</p>
